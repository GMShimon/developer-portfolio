            <p style="text-align:justify;">You mess with the Peaky Blinders and you get a bloodied face and a burnt bar. At least, if you anger Arthur, the loud-mouthed, hot-headed brother of family patriarch Thomas Shelby.

            <p>There is no harm in dreaming of becoming the world’s best. It is all about trying to be the best. I will keep working hard to achieve it but it is within my capabilities. Don’t let small obstacles be in the way of being victorious. Remember you are stronger than the challenges you face.</p>
