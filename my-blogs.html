            <p>
               <i> Jan 2020
                I had requested the activities and destinations that I had most wanted to see and do in advance to Mr. Rahman, Managing Director of Journey Wallet Ltd. These were fully addressed without any difficulty. My guide throughout, Mr.Awal was so attentive and provided excellent co-ordination with our car drivers at the various pick up and set down points. The car transfers were comfortable, clean,prompt and the drivers very polite and pleasant. Mr Awal had tremendous patience when I wanted to linger a while longer at a particular location. All my expectations were exceeded by the great team at journey Wallet particularly as my first visit to Bangladesh in 2019 , comprised only of a few days with little chance of doing the country justice. I would have no hesitation in using this tour operator in future visits.</i>
